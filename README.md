The aim of the game is to correctly guess the word that is generated. Each blank space represents a letter, and it's your job to guess the right letters.

# Classic Hangman Game

- To re-start the game, click the 'Play again' button any time at the bottom.
- Guess a letter by typing it on your computer. Choose carefully though, as you can only guess an incorrect letter ten times.
- If you guess correctly, the letter is revealed at the top but, if you don't, you lose one of your chances and the image changes, wrong letter will be displayed at the bottom as wrong .
- If you have entered a letter more than once a message pops up at the bottom of the screen saying that 'You have already entered this letter'.
- If you get every letter in the word before the final image is displayed, you win!
- However, if the final image is displayed and you still have not completed your word, you lose.
